	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
		Nodewars is a competitive programming game that blends elements of spacial domination and real time strategy.
		Set in the not-to-distant future, rival teams of hackers compete to control as many machines as possible.
		In this dark future, the only money that still hold any value is a digital currency known as CoinCoin.
		Teams use the networks they control to mine as much CoinCoin as possible.
		The more area a team controls, the more CoinCoin they can generate.
	</p>
	<h1>Interface</h1>
	<p>
		Let's start by getting familiar with the interface. If you're not familiar with programming environments,
		Nodewars' interface can seem a little overwhelming at first, so let's cover each window and what it does.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Main Window - Contains other windows, Layout menu can be used to save/recall window layouts</li>
		<li>Terminal - How you interact with the world, type help any time you get lost</li>
		<li>Map - Show who controls what and where you're connected. Useful in planning your next move</li>
		<li>Challenge Details - Once you're connected to a machine the programming challenge you have to solve will be described here</li>
		<li>Ace Editor - This is where you write your code. You can use the terminal or menu to compile but shortcuts are recommended</li>
		<li>Stdin - When you want to test and idea you can use this to feed your own input into your program</li>
		<li>Compiler Output - Any compile errors your code generates will appear here</li>
		<li>Score - This shows how much CoinCoin each team has. Whoever reaches the top first, wins!</li>
		<li>Test Results - This shows you how well you're code did at solving the current challenge</li>
	</ul>

		Gameplay
	</h1>
	Overview
	<p>
		There are a number of subtleties in Nodewars but the main gameplay is fairly straightforward.
		Generally a player will connect (con) to a node, select a machine they'd like to attach (at) to, and begin
		trying to solve whatever programming challenge is present at that machine.
